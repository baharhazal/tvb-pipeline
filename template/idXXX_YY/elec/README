Here you should place:
- T1 or CT scan in NIFTI format (*.nii, *.nii.gz) with implanted electrodes. This file should be named either MRI_elec.nii/MRI_elec.nii.gz for T1 MRI, or CT_elec.nii/CT_elec.nii.gz for CT scans.
- Text file specifying the endpoints and spacing of the electrodes (elec_endpoints.txt)
